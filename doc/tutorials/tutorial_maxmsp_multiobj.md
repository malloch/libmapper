Getting started
===============
Note: this tutorial will introduce the revised bindings for MaxMSP (July 2013). You can access the tutorial for the original bindings using the `[mapper]` object [here](./maxmsp_central.html).

To start using the _libmapper_ with MaxMSP you will need to:

* Install _libmapper_ for your platform (Linux, OSX, Windows)
* Download the external objects from our [downloads page](../downloads.html).
Alternatively, you can build the object from
[source](http://github.com/malloch/mapper-max-pd) instead.
* Download a [graphical user interface](../downloads.html#GUIs) for
  creating and editing mapping connections.

Devices
=======

Creating a device
-----------------

To create a _libmapper_ device, create an object called `[map.device]`
with an optional argument specifying the device's name.
There is an initialization period after a device is created where
a unique ordinal is chosen to append to the device name.
This allows multiple devices with the same name to
exist on the network. If no name is given libmapper will choose a
name for your device starting with the string "maxmsp".

Your device will start with no inputs or outputs, so it will not yet show
up in most GUIs.

You can also provide arbitrary properties to your device using jitter-style
properties.  By default, libmapper will try to guess which network
interface to use for mapping, defaulting to the local loopback interface
ethernet or wifi is not available.  You can force the object to use a
particular interface by using the `@interface` property.

An example of creating a device:

![Creating a device.](./images/maxmsp_multiobj1.png)

Once the object has initialized, it will output its metadata from its outlet:

* The complete device name, including an appended ordinal for distinguishing
between multiple active devices with the same name.
* The IP address and port in use by the object.
* The number of input and output signals associated with the object
(none to start).
* The network interface in use by the object.

If and when this information changes, the object will output the updated
property.


Multiple devices
----------------

Once you have created a `[map.device]` object in a patcher, it considers
itself to be the "parent" device for that patcher and all of its subpatchers.
This means that it you try to create a second copy of the device in the same
patcher, or in one of its child subpatchers, the object instantiation will fail.
When the object is created, it checks whether there is a pre-existing device
that would cause a conflict.

You can, however, create multiple `[map.device]` objects in the same patch as
long as they are both contained in different subpatchers.


Signals
=======

Now that we have created a device, we only need to know how to
add signals in order to give our program some input/output functionality.

We'll start with creating a "sender", so we will first talk about how
to create and update output signals.

Creating a signal
-----------------

Creating input and output signals is accomplished with the `[map.in]` and
`[map.out]` objects, which requires two pieces of information: 

* a name for the signal
* the signal's data type expressed as a character 'i' for `integer`, 'f'
for `float`

A third optional integer argument sets the signal's vector length,
if it is omitted the signal is assumed to have length 1.
Additional signal properties can also (optionally) be added:

* the signal's unit, e.g. `@unit Hz`
* the signal's minimum value, e.g. `@min 0`
* the signal's maximum value, e.g. `@max 100`

examples:

![Adding signals to a device](./images/maxmsp_multiobj2.png)

The only _required_ parameters here are the signal name and data type,
but the more information you provide, the more the mapper can do some
things automatically.  For example, if `minimum` and `maximum` are
provided, it will be possible to create linear-scaled connections very
quickly.  If `unit` is provided, the mapper will be able to similarly
figure out a linear scaling based on unit conversion. (Centimeters to
inches for example.) Currently automatic unit-based scaling is not a
supported feature, but will be added in the future.  You can take
advantage of this future development by simply providing unit
information whenever it is available.  It is also helpful documentation
for users.

An example of a `float` signal where some more information is provided:

![Adding a floating-point output signal with some optional properties](./images/maxmsp_multiobj3.png)

So far we know how to create a device and to specify an output signal
for it.


Updating signals
----------------

We can imagine the above program getting sensor information in a loop.
It could be running on a computer and reading data from an Arduino
over a USB serial port, or it could just be a mouse-controlled GUI
slider.  However it's getting the data, it must provide it to
_libmapper_ so that it will be sent to other devices if that signal
is mapped.

This is accomplished by passing ints or floats to the `[map.out]` object.
In the case of vector signals, a list with the same number of elements
should be used.

So in the "sensor 1 voltage" example, assuming that we have some code
which reads sensor 1's value into a float variable in `[p read_sensor]`,
the patch becomes:

![Updating a signal](./images/maxmsp_multiobj4.png)

This is about all that is needed to expose sensor 1's voltage to the
network as a mappable parameter.  The _libmapper_ GUI can now be used
to create a mapping between this value and a receiver, where it could
control a synthesizer parameter or change the brightness of an LED,
or whatever else you want to do.

Signal conditioning
-------------------

Most synthesizers of course will not know what to do with
"voltage"--it is an electrical property that has nothing to do with
sound or music.  This is where _libmapper_ really becomes useful.

Scaling or other signal conditioning can be taken care of _before_
exposing the signal, or it can be performed as part of the mapping.
Since the end user can demand any mathematical operation be performed
on the signal, he can perform whatever mappings between signals as he
wishes.

As a developer, it is therefore your job to provide information that
will be useful to the end user.

For example, if sensor 1 is a position sensor, instead of publishing
"voltage", you could convert it to centimeters or meters based on the
known dimensions of the sensor, and publish a "/sensor1/position"
signal instead, providing the unit information as well.

We call such signals "semantic", because they provide information with
more meaning than a relatively uninformative value based on the
electrical properties of the sensing technique.  Some sensors can
benefit from low-pass filtering or other measures to reduce noise.
Some sensor data may need to be combined in order to derive physical
meaning.  What you choose to expose as outputs of your device is
entirely application-dependent.

You can even publish both "/sensor1/position" and "/sensor1/voltage"
if desired, in order to expose both processed and raw data.  Keep in
mind that these will not take up significant processing time, and
_zero_ network bandwidth, if they are not mapped.

Receiving signals
-----------------

Receiving signals is even easier: create a `[map.in]` object with a
name and type, and updates for this signal will be routed to its outlet.
The arguments for the `[map.in]` object are identical to `[map.out]`.

Let's try making two devices in the same patch for testing.

![Sending and receiving signal updates](./images/maxmsp_multiobj5.png)

If you use your mapping GUI to create a link between the two devices
_sender_ and _receiver_ and a connection between your two signals
_/sendsig_ and _/recvsig_, any change made to the float value on the left
will cause a corresponding output on the right.

Congratulations - you have created your first mapping connection! This
probably seems quite simplistic, since you could have made a patch-cord
between the two float objects and accomplished the same thing, but your
"mapping" represents something more:

* It can be edited remotely from another machine on the network.
* It can connect signals on different computers.
* It can connect different signals implemented in different programming
 languages such as C, C++, Python, Java, and SuperCollider.
* It can be edited to provide signal processing, including automatic
 linear scaling, calibration, muting, clipping, or an arbitrary
 expression - even FIR and IIR filters.


Publishing metadata
===================

Things like device names, signal units, and ranges, are examples of
metadata â€” information about the data you are exposing on the network.

_libmapper_ also provides the ability to specify arbitrary extra
metadata in the form of name-value pairs.  These are not interpreted
by _libmapper_ in any way, but can be retrieved over the network.
This can be used for instance to label a device with its location, or
to perhaps give a signal some property like "reliability", or some
category like "light", "motor", "shaker", etc.

Some GUI implementing a Monitor could then use this information to
display information about the network in an intelligent manner.

Any time there may be extra knowledge about a signal or device, it is
a good idea to represent it by adding such properties, which can be of
any OSC-compatible type.  (So, numbers and strings, etc.)

The MaxMSP bindings for libmapper do not currently allow dynamically
changing the properties of a device or signal, however they can be
declared when the entity is created by using jitter-style property
arguments

For example, to store a `float` indicating the X position of a device
`dev`, you could instantiate your object like this:

![Adding extra properties to a device](./images/maxmsp_multiobj6.png)

To specify a string property of a signal:

![Adding extra properties to a signal](./images/maxmsp_multiobj7.png)

In general you can use any property name not already in use by the
device or signal data structure.  Reserved words for signals are: 
`device_name` `direction` `length` `name` `type`

for devices, they are: `host` `port` `name`
